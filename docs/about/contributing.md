## Using Conventional Commits

Conventional commits provide a structured way to format commit messages, making it easier to understand the purpose of each commit at a glance. Below is a breakdown of different conventional commit types and their meanings:

| Type     | Description                                                                                   |
|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| feat     | Represents the addition of a new feature.                                                     |
| fix      | Indicates a bug fix.                                                                          |
| docs     | Pertains to documentation changes.                                                            |
| style    | Covers changes in code formatting, whitespace, or semicolons, without affecting code meaning. |
| refactor | Denotes code refactoring that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature.                         |
| perf     | Signifies performance improvements.                                                           |
| test     | Involves adding or correcting tests.                                                          |
| build    | Relates to changes affecting the build system or external dependencies.                       |
| ci       | Involves changes to Continuous Integration configuration files and scripts.                   |
| chore    | Encompasses other changes that don't modify source or test files.                             |
| revert   | Reverts a previous commit.                                                                    |

When using conventional commits, it's essential to structure commit messages in a specific format. Here's an example of a conventional commit message:

```
feat: add user authentication functionality
```

In this example:
- `feat` represents the type of commit, which is adding a new feature.
- The message following the colon describes the feature added in a concise and descriptive manner.

By following the conventional commit format, it becomes easier to manage and track changes within a project, enhancing collaboration and communication among contributors.

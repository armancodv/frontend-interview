## 1. What is Javascript?

JavaScript is a type of computer programming language that's commonly used to make websites interactive. It works alongside HTML and CSS to bring web pages to life by adding things like animations, interactive forms, and dynamic content. JavaScript can be thought of as the language that makes websites do cool stuff when you click on buttons, submit forms, or scroll through a page. It's versatile and powerful, allowing developers to create all sorts of features that make websites more engaging and user-friendly.

## 2. What are the key features of JavaScript?

JavaScript, often called JS, has some key features that make it unique. Firstly, it's versatile, meaning it can run in various environments like web browsers, servers, or even in hardware like robots. Secondly, it's dynamic, allowing changes to be made while a program is running, making it very flexible. Another important feature is its event-driven nature, meaning it can respond to actions like clicks or inputs from users. Additionally, JavaScript supports functions, which are blocks of code that can be reused, making programs easier to manage. Lastly, it's an interpreted language, meaning it doesn't need to be compiled before running, making it quick to develop and test code. These features combined make JavaScript a powerful language for creating interactive and dynamic web pages.

::: tip
- Versatility: JavaScript can run in various environments such as web browsers, servers, and hardware.
- Dynamic: Allows changes to be made while a program is running, enhancing flexibility.
- Event-driven: Capable of responding to user actions like clicks or inputs.
- Functions: Supports reusable blocks of code, aiding in program organization and management.
- Interpreted: Doesn't require compilation before running, facilitating quick development and testing of code.

## 3. What kind of language is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a type of programming language. It's considered high-level, which means it's easier for people to understand compared to lower-level languages that computers can directly understand. It follows a set of rules called the ECMAScript standard. JavaScript can change its data type while the program is running, which is called dynamic typing. It's built around creating objects based on other objects, and it treats functions as special objects, allowing them to be used in many different ways. You can use it in different programming styles like event-driven, functional, and imperative. It also provides tools for working with text, dates, and organizing web pages.

::: tip
- JavaScript is a high-level programming language.
- It conforms to the ECMAScript standard.
- JavaScript uses dynamic typing, meaning it can change data types during runtime.
- It is prototype-based for object-orientation.
- Functions are treated as first-class citizens, allowing for versatile use.
- Supports multiple programming paradigms including event-driven, functional, and imperative.
- Provides APIs for tasks such as working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM).

## 4. What is dynamic typing in programming languages?

Dynamic typing in programming languages like JavaScript means that you don't have to declare the data type of a variable explicitly when you create it. Instead, the type of the variable is determined automatically based on the type of value it holds. This allows for flexibility because you can assign different types of values to the same variable without any strict rules about data types. For example, a variable could hold a number at one point and then hold a string or an object at another point in the program. Dynamic typing simplifies coding because you don't need to worry about specifying data types, but it also requires careful attention to avoid unexpected behavior due to type mismatches.

::: tip
- Dynamic typing in JavaScript means you don't have to specify the data type of a variable when you create it.
- The type of the variable is automatically determined based on the type of value it holds at runtime.
- This flexibility allows variables to hold different types of values during the execution of a program.
- You can assign numbers, strings, objects, or other types of data to the same variable without declaring its type explicitly.
- While dynamic typing simplifies coding by removing the need to specify data types, it requires careful attention to prevent unexpected behavior caused by type mismatches.

## 5. What is prototype-based programming?

In programming, particularly in JavaScript (js), a prototype-based language means that objects are created based on existing objects, rather than using classes as in traditional object-oriented languages. In simpler terms, you can make new objects by starting with old ones and changing or adding things to them. Each object in JavaScript has a prototype property which points to another object. When you try to access a property or method on an object and it's not found, JavaScript looks at the object's prototype to see if the property or method exists there. This concept allows for flexible and dynamic object creation and inheritance in JavaScript programming.

::: tip
- Prototype-based programming in JavaScript means objects are created based on existing objects.
- Instead of using classes like in traditional object-oriented languages, new objects are made by modifying existing ones.
- Each object in JavaScript has a prototype property pointing to another object.
- When accessing a property or method on an object, JavaScript checks its prototype if the property or method isn't found directly on the object.
- This approach allows for flexible and dynamic object creation and inheritance in JavaScript.

## 6. What does it mean for a function to be a first-class citizen?

In JavaScript, when we say a function is a first-class citizen, it means that functions are treated like any other regular data types, such as numbers or strings. This allows us to store functions in variables, pass them as arguments to other functions, and even return them from functions. Basically, functions can be used in the same way we use other types of data in our code. This flexibility makes JavaScript a powerful language for writing programs because it allows for more dynamic and versatile coding possibilities.

::: tip
- In JavaScript, a function being a first-class citizen means it's treated like any other regular data type.
- Functions can be stored in variables.
- They can be passed as arguments to other functions.
- Functions can also be returned from other functions.

## 7. What does it mean for a language to be multi-paradigm?

A multi-paradigm language like JavaScript (JS) means it can be used in different styles or approaches to solve problems. In simpler terms, it's like having multiple tools in one toolbox. In JavaScript, you can use procedural programming, which is like following a step-by-step recipe, or object-oriented programming, where you create and manipulate objects like building blocks. Additionally, you can use functional programming, treating functions as first-class citizens, like pieces of Lego you can combine in various ways. Having all these options in one language makes JavaScript versatile, allowing developers to choose the best approach for different tasks.

::: tip
- Multi-paradigm language like JavaScript (JS) means it supports various programming styles.
- JavaScript allows procedural programming, akin to following step-by-step instructions.
- It also facilitates object-oriented programming, where developers work with objects as building blocks.
- Functional programming is another approach in JavaScript, treating functions as primary elements for task execution.
- Having these multiple paradigms in JavaScript makes it versatile, enabling developers to choose the most suitable approach for different tasks.

## 8. What does it mean for a language to be high level?

When we say a language is high-level like JavaScript (js), it means it's designed to be easy for people to understand and use. High-level languages are closer to human language, so writing code in them is more like writing instructions for people to follow. They come with built-in functions and features that make coding easier and more efficient, without needing to worry about the nitty-gritty details of how the computer works underneath. In simple words, high-level languages like JavaScript help developers focus on solving problems rather than getting lost in technical complexities.

::: tip
- A high-level language like JavaScript (js) is easy for people to understand and use.
- It's designed to be closer to human language, making coding feel like giving instructions.
- High-level languages come with built-in functions and features for easier coding.
- Developers can focus on solving problems rather than technical complexities.
- They don't need to worry about how the computer works underneath.

## 9. What is object-oriented programming (OOP)?

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a way of writing computer programs where you organize your code around objects, which are like containers that hold data and functions. Each object can do specific tasks and communicate with other objects. It's like building with Lego bricks, where each brick (object) has its own unique features and can interact with other bricks to create something bigger and more complex. OOP helps make programs easier to understand, modify, and reuse because it breaks down complex problems into smaller, manageable parts.

## 10. What are the four principles of object-oriented programming (OOP)?

In object-oriented programming (OOP), there are four main principles:

1. Encapsulation: This means bundling data (variables) and methods (functions) that work on the data into a single unit, called an object. It helps in organizing and controlling access to the data, ensuring that it's only modified in appropriate ways.

2. Abstraction: Abstraction involves hiding complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object. It allows programmers to focus on what an object does rather than how it does it, making the code more manageable and easier to understand.

3. Inheritance: Inheritance enables a new class (called a subclass or derived class) to inherit properties and behaviors (methods) from an existing class (called a superclass or base class). This promotes code reuse and allows for the creation of a hierarchy of classes with shared characteristics.

4. Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. This means that a single interface can be used to access objects of various types, making the code more flexible and adaptable to different situations.

## 11. What is encapsulation in object-oriented programming (OOP)?

Encapsulation in JavaScript, especially in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), is like keeping things safe in a box. It's a way to bundle data and functions together, sort of like putting them in a container. This helps keep things organized and prevents them from being messed up accidentally. In JavaScript, you can create objects that have properties (the data) and methods (the functions), and encapsulation means keeping these properties and methods together within the object, so they work together neatly without interfering with other parts of the code. It's like having a tidy package where everything you need is stored together.

::: tip
- Encapsulation in JavaScript involves bundling data and functions together within an object.

## 12. What is inheritance in object-oriented programming (OOP)?

Inheritance in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a concept where one object can inherit properties and methods from another object. It allows us to create a hierarchy of objects where child objects can reuse and extend the functionality of parent objects. This means that if we have a parent object with certain properties and methods, we can create a new object based on that parent, inheriting all its features, and then add more specific features to it. For example, if we have a "Vehicle" object with properties like "color" and methods like "drive", we can create a "Car" object that inherits from "Vehicle" and adds specific features like "numberOfSeats" or "carType". This helps in organizing and managing code effectively, promoting reusability and scalability.

::: tip
- Inheritance in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) allows one object to inherit properties and methods from another object.

## 13. What is polymorphism in object-oriented programming (OOP)?

Polymorphism in JavaScript, which stands for Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), refers to the ability of different objects to be treated as if they were the same type. In simpler words, it's like having multiple objects that can do similar things but in their own unique way. For example, imagine you have different shapes like circles, squares, and triangles. Even though they all have different properties and methods, you can still use a general function to calculate their areas because they all share a common characteristic of being shapes. This flexibility and versatility make programming in JavaScript more efficient and adaptable to different situations.

## 14. What is abstraction in object-oriented programming (OOP)?

Abstraction in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is about hiding the complex inner workings of code and showing only the necessary features to the outside world. It's like using a TV remote without knowing how the circuits inside work. In OOP, abstraction allows us to focus on what an object does rather than how it does it. For instance, when we use a method like `.toFixed()` to round a number to a fixed decimal point, we don't need to know the detailed math behind it; we just use the method and get the result we want. This helps in simplifying code and making it easier to understand and use.
